# Divercity---Kode with Klossy 2020 Final Group Project
## By Aakanksa, Lisa, and Rachel

### Overview:
We created this project to provide BLM resources related to various cities, allowing the user to find local resources to support the 
movement. In our app we inform users about different people and different events that occured in major cities around the US. We promote 
different local businesses and petitions centered around these cities. By stimulating the economy and promoting more black owned 
businesses, we can learn more about culture and fight against racism.

### What our app does:
1. We feature one person who has been affected by systematic racism, violence, or other inhumane acts. Itâ€™s important to learn and fight for change.
2. Our app provides multiple petitions based on the city! Signing petitions is an easy and effective way to make change.
3. Our random business generator directs the user to a random black owned business in their city by providing the link to their website. 

### Our app uses these three main functionalities:
1. Drop down menus:

We used Xcode and Swift to program the application, which we have made compatible for iPhone 11.
